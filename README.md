# Service Catalog Helm Charts

This branch is a repository for Service Catalog's helm charts.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add svc-cat https://dbonk8s.github.io/service-catalog
```

You can then run `helm search service-catalog` to see the charts.
